# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## The Issue
Your deployment is working correctly - the `gh-pages` branch contains all the built files. However, GitHub Pages needs to be enabled in your repository settings.

## Fix: Enable GitHub Pages (One-time Setup)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub:
   - https://github.com/ar210505/rubric-coder-intel

2. Click **Settings** (top menu)

3. Scroll down and click **Pages** (left sidebar)

4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Select `gh-pages` and `/root` (or `/(root)`)
   - Click **Save**

5. Wait 1-2 minutes for the deployment

6. Visit your live site:
   - https://ar210505.github.io/rubric-coder-intel/

## What I Fixed

- **Removed the CNAME bug**: The workflow was creating a CNAME file with "false" as content, which broke GitHub Pages routing
- **Verified build output**: All files are correctly built with the `/rubric-coder-intel/` base path
- **Confirmed gh-pages branch**: The deployment branch exists and contains all necessary files

## Verification

Once you enable Pages in Settings, you should see:
- ✅ Green deploy badge in README
- ✅ Live site accessible at https://ar210505.github.io/rubric-coder-intel/
- ✅ All assets loading correctly

## Troubleshooting

If the site still doesn't work after enabling Pages:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
2. Try in a private/incognito window
3. Wait up to 5 minutes for CDN propagation
4. Check the Actions tab for any workflow errors

**Your site is ready to go live - just enable Pages in Settings!**
