## 🚀 Next Steps (Complete These Now)

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations ⚠️ REQUIRED

**Instructions:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ctevefzqqrytbptoovmw/editor/sql
2. Click **"+ New query"**
3. Copy the ENTIRE contents of this file:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/20251013183058_b2253462-8310-4d46-8d6e-a59641a300d9.sql
   ```
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"** button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
6. You should see: ✅ "Success. No rows returned"

**This creates:**
- ✅ `profiles` table (user information)
- ✅ `rubrics` table (evaluation rubrics)

**Verify:** Go to **Table Editor** in sidebar - you should see all 4 tables listed.
